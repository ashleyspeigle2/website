  based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Indians compete in Major League Baseball
 (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division.
 Since 1994, they have played at Progressive Field. The team's spring

 their establishment as a major league franchise in 1901, the Indians
 have won two World Series championships: in 1920 and 1948, along with
 nine Central Division titles and six American League pennants.
